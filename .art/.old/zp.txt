Option to use either a separate console command OR the Jump button

Go to Options > V92 > ZParachute to customize your options
Go to your context menu and click on the ZParachute icon to choose a model

Press your USE key to flare the chute, but if you flare it too long it will collapse and send you falling to your death.
Press your FORWARD and BACK keys to accelerate and decelerate your descent while parachuting.
Press WALK + CROUCH at the same time to cut the chute and go into free fall.
